Why Use an Automated Enumeration Tool?
Efficiency: Manual enumeration of Linux systems can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Automated tools streamline the process, allowing administrators to quickly gather relevant information.

Consistency: Automated tools ensure consistent results across different systems and environments, reducing the likelihood of overlooking critical details.

Scalability: In large or complex environments with multiple Linux systems, automated enumeration tools can scale effectively, providing consistent results across all systems.

Security: Regular enumeration of Linux systems is essential for identifying security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, unauthorized users or processes, and other potential risks. Automated tools facilitate this process and help organizations maintain a robust security posture.
